Maven Sales Challenge: CRM Dashboard Replication

📊 Project Overview

This is a learning project where I recreated the winning solution from the Maven Analytics Sales Challenge. I analyzed the same CRM dataset and built an identical performance dashboard to understand the approach of top data analysts.
