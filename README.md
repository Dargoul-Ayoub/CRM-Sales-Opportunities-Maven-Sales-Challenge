Maven Sales Challenge: CRM Dashboard Replication
A learning project where I recreated the winning solution from the Maven Analytics Sales Challenge by analyzing the same CRM dataset and building an identical performance dashboard.

üìä Project Overview
This repository contains my attempt to reverse-engineer and replicate the winning solution from the Maven Analytics Sales Challenge. By analyzing the same dataset and studying the champion's approach, I rebuilt a comprehensive sales performance dashboard for Melvin Marxen's sales team that mirrors the original winning submission.

Original Winning Solution: Maven Showcase - CRM Sales Performance Dashboard

üèÜ Learning Objective
This project was undertaken as a learning exercise to:

Understand how top data analysts approach complex sales datasets

Replicate advanced dashboard design and visualization techniques

Practice building professional-level business intelligence reports

Learn how to structure analyses that tell compelling data stories

Note: This is not my original solution concept, but rather a recreation of the challenge-winning approach using the same data and methodology. 
All credit for the analytical approach and dashboard design goes to the original winner.
